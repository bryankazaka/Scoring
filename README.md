# Scoring
A collection of precious gems is being sold. In an attempt to prevent a single buyer from purchasing
them all, the cost increases, greater than linearly, with the number of gems bought.
The total cost to buy K gems is f(K) where f(K) is defined as the sum of j * (K/j) for all integers 0 < j <
K. (Note that K/j here uses integer division, so the result has no fractional part. For example: 8/3
would equal 2.)
As an example, to buy 5 gems, the cost, f(5), would be calculated as:
1 * (5/1) + 2 * (5/2) + 3 * (5/3) + 4 * (5/4) = 1*5 + 2*2 + 3*1 + 4*1 = 16
Write a program that, given an amount of currency, N, calculates the greatest value of K for which
f(K) ≤ N i.e., Write a program that calculates the largest number of gems that can be bought for a
given amount of money.
Example:
Given N = 30:
f(6) = 1 * (6/1) + 2 * (6/2) + 3 * (6/3) + 4 * (6/4) + 5 * (6/5)
= 1*6 + 2*3 + 3*2 + 4*1 + 5*1
= 27
f(7) = 1 * (7/1) + 2 * (7/2) + 3 * (7/3) + 4 * (7/4) + 5 * (7/5) + 6 * (7/6)
= 1*7 + 2*3 + 3*2 + 4*1 + 5*1 + 6*1
= 34
So the maximum number of gems that could be purchased would be 6.
Note that the function f(K) is *strictly increasing*.
Note that values used in this question can be larger than the maximum value of a 32-bit integer
type, requiring the use of 64-bit integer types (long in Java, long long in C and C++).
Constraints
1 ≤ K ≤ 1,000,000
This means that the input value N is bounded by:
1 ≤ N ≤ f(1,000,000) i.e. 1 ≤ N ≤ 822467118437

Input and Output
Program input and output will make use of stdio streams (System.in and System.out in
Java) i.e., not file I/O.
Input consists of a single line containing a single integer value, N, the maximum amount of currency
that can be spent.
Output consists of a single integer, K (the maximum number of gems that can be purchased),
followed by a line break --- in Java, for example, use System.out.println, not
System.out.print. The automatic marker expects this precise form.
Sample Input:
30
Sample output:
6
